# MAREE DES LETTRES

Welcome to Marée Des Lettres, a playful art installation along the Seine. Starting at Nuit Blanche 2017, letters will appear along the river. In a space once dedicatd to cars going from A to B, let's play with vehicles of meaning from A to Z! Read on to find out about the different ways to play. Enjoy!

## THE BIG LETTERS

42 big letters (and 3 special characters) are installed at the Berges de Seine for Nuit Blanche. But in which order? What will they say? You can VOTE on SUGGESTIONS by others and make SUGGESTIONS yourself. The letters will be continuously rearranged in a series of votes during NUIT BLANCHE, each vote corresponding to a topic.

## HOW TO VOTE 

You can vote on everyone's suggestions! Go to the VOTE section of the app and select a topic you find interesting. Then swipe through the stack of suggestions for this topic. If you are a more organized person, you can also tap on the LIST button to vote from a list. Pull down the list to refresh the current voting data. You can change your mind and re-vote at any time!

## HOW TO MAKE A SUGGESTION

You can make one suggestion per topic. Select a topic and tap on SUGGEST. Now you can arrange the letters as you wish! You can make a suggestion until 15 minutes before the end of voting. Please keep in mind that each suggestion is reviewed to conform to our community guidelines.

## WINNING A VOTE

At the end of each voting phase, the suggestion with the biggest difference between positive and negative votes wins. We score each suggestion by subtracting the negative votes from the positive votes. For example, if a suggestion has 67 positive votes and 12 negative votes, it has a score of 55 and is better than a suggestion with 390 positive votes and 412 negative votes (score: -22).

## FLUX OF LETTERS

All around the democratic arrangement of the big letters there is also the constant flux of letters! Become a letter yourself! Go to the FLUX section and chose which letter you want to be for the next 24 hours. You can now write this letter on the map. Move around in the real world to find just the right place to add your letter. Team up with friends and strangers to exchange letters! But watch out, letters only stay on the map for a certain amount of time. Use the camera function to take pictures of yourself with the letters around you.

## COMMUNITY GUIDELINES

By using this app, you agree to abide by these simple guidelines when creating content with this app: You are welcome to be creative, funny, weird... but please no advertisements, no attacks on individuals or groups, no personal data, no messages supporting racist, sexist, homophic or otherwise hateful agendas. A representative of the municipality of Paris has the last word on what is accepted for voting or removed from the map.
