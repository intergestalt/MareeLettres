# MAREE DES LETTRES

Welcome to Mar√©e Des Lettres, a playful art installation along the Seine. Starting at Nuit Blanche 2017, letters will appear along the river. In a space once dedicatd to cars going from A to B, let's play with vehicles of meaning from A to Z! Read on to find out about the different ways to play. Enjoy!

## THE BIG LETTERS

42 big letters (and 3 special characters) are installed at the Berges de Seine for Nuit Blanche. But in which order? What will they say? You can SUGGEST arrangements and VOTE for arrangements suggested by others. The letters will be continuously rearranged during NUIT BLANCHE.

## HOW TO VOTE 

You can vote on all arrangements suggested by others! Go to the ABC section of the app and select a topic you find interesting. Then swipe through the stack of suggestions. If you are a more organized person, you can also tap on the OVERVIEW button to vote from a list. Pull down the list to refresh the current voting data. You can change your mind and re-vote at any time!

## HOW TO MAKE A SUGGESTION

You can make one suggestion per topic. Select a topic you find interesting and tap on SUGGEST. Now you can arrange the letters as you wish! You can make a suggestion until 15 minutes before the end of voting. Please keep in mind that each suggestion is reviewed to conform to our community guidelines. If your arrangement was already suggested by someone else, your suggestions will be combined and get an extra 5 votes!

## WINNING A VOTE

At the end of each voting phase, the suggestion with the biggest difference between positive and negative votes wins. We score each suggestion by subtracting the negative votes from the positive votes. For example, if a suggestion has 67 positive votes and 12 negative votes, it has a score of 55 and is better than a suggestion with 390 positive votes and 412 negative votes (score: -22).

## FLUX OF LETTERS

All around the democratic arrangement of the big letters there is also the constant flux of letters! Along the Seine and beyond you can find your own area to continously express your thoughts and ideas. Become a letter yourself! Go to the FLUX section and chose which letter you want to be for the next 24 hours. You can now write this letter on the map. Move around in the real world to find just the right place to add your letter. Team up with friends and strangers to exchange letters! But watch out, letters only stay on the map for a certain amount of time.Use the camera function to take pictures of yourself with the letters around you.
