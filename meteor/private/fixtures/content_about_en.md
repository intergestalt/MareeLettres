# MAREE DES LETTRES

Welcome to Marée Des Lettres, a playful art installation along the Seine. Starting at Nuit Blanche, letters will appear along the river - in big physical form and virtually on a collaborative map. In a space once dedicatd to cars going from A to B, let's play with vehicles of meaning from A to Z! Read on to find out about the different ways to play. Enjoy!"

## THE BIG LETTERS

There are 42 big letters and 3 special characters you can chose from to form words and sentences. The letters will be rearanged throughout Nuit Blanche in a series of votes about different questions. The last vote will determine how the letters stay for the next 4 weeks."

## WINNING A VOTE

At the end of each voting phase, the answer with the biggest difference between positive and negative votes wins. We score each answer by subtracting the negative votes from the positive votes. For example, if an answer has 67 positive votes and 12 negative votes, it has a score of 55 and is better than an answer with 390 positive votes and 412 negative votes (score: -22)."

## THE LETTER MAP

Marée des Lettres is not only about the big letters! All along the Seine and beyond you can find your own area to continously express your thoughts and ideas. Go to the MAP section and chose which letter you want to be for the next 24 hours. You can now write this letter on the map. Move around in the real world to find just the right place to add your letter. Team up with friends and strangers to exchange letters! But watch out, letters only stay on the map for a certain amount of time. Use the camera function to take pictures of yourself with the letters around you."
