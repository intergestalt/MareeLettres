## WELCOME

Welcome to MARÉE DES LETTRES, a playful art installation along the Seine.

During Nuit Blanche 2017, big letters will appear along the river. In a space once dedicated to cars, let's play with vehicles of meaning from A to Z! 

To take part actively, please download the app following the links above.

## HOW DOES IT WORK?

42 big letters (and 3 special characters) will be installed at the Berges de Seine. But in which order? What will they say?

The letters will be continuously rearranged in a series of votes during NUIT BLANCHE. Each voting phase corresponds to a topic. Participants make suggestions and vote for suggestions via the Marée des Lettres app.

## WINNING SUGGESTIONS 

At the end of each voting phase, the suggestion with the biggest difference between positive and negative votes wins. This suggestion will be arranged in realtime at the Berges de Seine. 

For example, if a suggestion has 67 positive votes and 12 negative votes, it has a score of 55 and is better than a suggestion with 390 positive votes and 412 negative votes (score: -22).

## FLUX

All around the democratic arrangement of the big letters is the constant flux of letters. Using the app, players become letters themselves, can exchange letters with others and collaboratively write on the map. Enjoy a FLUX of words and concrete poetry! 

By using the camera function of their mobile phones user can take pictures of themselves with the letters around them. Some of them might appear in the NEWS section.


## FUTURE OF THE LETTERS

After Nuit Blanche, the big letters will stay at the river banks for a while and will then be deinstalled to make space for other events. But Marée des Lettres stays in Paris. The artwork, including the big letters and the voting system belongs to the municipality and can be used by Parisian projects in the fields of art, participation, revitalization of neighborhoods and public spaces.
