# MareeLettres Website

It's plain and simple React Website fatching data from the REST API. It only displays an overview of the game status, creates no input. Try to share some styles or components or configuration with the react native app.

maybe use `$ create-react-app site`

pro: make it run in the public folder of the meteor server (so for low load times, only one container is required)
